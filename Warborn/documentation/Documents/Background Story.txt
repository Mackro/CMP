Background story

At the dawn of time, gods where created, each with their own purposes.
As time grew so did the gods will and their eager to fulfill that which they were created for.
Soon their will started to conflict with their bretherens purposes and a civil war broke out among the gods.
God turned on god, constructions, worlds destroyed and the universe fell into darkness and towards oblivion.
This was when The Council Of Esphiroth, the gods creators, intervened. They destroyed the gods sealing away
the gods essence in the world of Hemesis. What the council had not forseen however was that some of the gods
power still remained in the essance and now spread throughout Hemesis.

Hemesis, a beautiful world, now corrupted with the essence of the gods. But even though the essence now runs through
every meadow and flows through every sea, only a few inhabitants of the world are truly infected, these being are
known as Warborn. A Warborn is a being that have the essance of a god flowing freely throughout their body and 
are able to unleashed it at will, displaying great power and often seen by their folk as a god.

But having the essence of a god running through your veins comes with a price. The Warborn have an unquenchable
thirst for glory and conquest and in some cases chaos and death. The Power they wield, they power of the old gods,
draws energy to cast energy that is almost only found in souls. Thereby the Warborn is always lead down a path of
conquest and with a great vision of becoming the one and only supreme WARBORN.
