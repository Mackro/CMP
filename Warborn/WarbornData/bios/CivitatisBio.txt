Civitatis is the god of light and one of the few gods to advocate peace. When the gods lunged upon their own kind, Civitatis stood in the middle trying to defend her brothers and sister from destroying each other. Despising all forms of combat she utilises her power to defend and heal. Yet despite the good nature of Civitatis, the rage that dwells within each god can still be found in the afflicted Warborn who wields the power of Civitatis for their own glory.
