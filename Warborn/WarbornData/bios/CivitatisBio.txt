Civitatis is the god of light and one of the few gods to advocate peace. When the gods lunge upon another Civitatis stood in the middle trying to defend her brothers and sister from destroying each other. Despising all forms of combat civitatis instead using her power to defend and heal. Yet altough the good nature of civitatis the rage that dwells within each good can still be found in the afflicted Warborn who uses the  power of Civitatis for there own glory.
