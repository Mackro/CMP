The Land of the Asqauter is a land of variation,
from the frozen realm of surrounding the great
Northen City to the vast Forest of Kings.

The land is surrounded by mountains to the south
 and a great sea to the north making the Land of
 the Asgauter the perfect killing field and 
perfect for a new kingdom.
